                            During these years I was initiated very slowly to computer science; I discovered a new world full of possibilities and I was very quickly impassioned by this domains, I started to make my first programs (on scratch for example); to program my first robots with arduino and mblock

                            During this last year of high school I decided to keep the math course and the NSI course, this course seemed to me more judicious for my further studies. I was able to specialize in Python and SQL and develop my first skills in networks and Linux. This year I also applied in BUT RT at the University of Colmar where I was accepted, I could progress in many areas and be sure of my choice of orientation
